Poker AI Sketch


Sketch of Texas hold 'em poker card representation as a graph
Background
- 52 cards each as nodes
- fully connected graph

Graph Restrictions:
	- no duplicate cards in the graph (ex. the graph cannot have 2 Ah's)

Node, edge level important characteristics:
- Node level important characteristics
	- rank of the card. higher rank hands are stronger
	- suit of the card (important for when 2 nodes are connected)
    - location of card (hole card, board card, still in deck)
        - cards still in deck have potential and is valuable information. What is shared between players (board cards) is also valuable information
    - Node features = [rank(0-12), suit(0-3), in_hand(0,1), on_board(0,1)]
- Edge/Connection level important characteristics
	- if the 2 nodes are the same suit (same suit is stronger, flush potential)
	- if the 2 nodes are close in rank (note ace can be low straight or high straigh so not necessarily close in rank)
    - edge features = [suited(0,1), connectedness (0-5)]
        - For connectedness it is only strong in the context of a straight which is only 5 cards so cards beyond that are 0 for connected, 4 for next to each other, 5 for pairs
- Graph level important characteristics
    - Number of cards on board and in hand vs number of cards left in deck
    - graph features = [num_on_board_and_hand, num_left_in_deck]


Domain Specific Keys:
- ordering does not matter when cards on the board are observed
	- once a card comes on the turn the information that it came on the turn is useless
- the number of cards left to come is important (with just hole cards and flop there is more potential for your hand to improve)
	- with all cards out there (2 in hand, 5 on the board) there is no potential for improvement your hand is what it is. Nothing else matters except the current/final strength of your hand and the decision you are facing (bet, raise, fold)

This graph representation will be combined with other game state information like number of players, stack sizes, player priors, etc.
for decision making downstream tasks.
